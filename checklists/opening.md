# Chess Move Selection Checklist - Opening

Instructions: Don't use memorized opening theory, instead think from first principles!

## 1. Safety & Basic Tactics

- Is my king in check?
- Are any of my pieces hanging?
- Can I win material with a simple capture?
- Check for immediate tactical threats against me or that I can make

## 2. Development Assessment

- **Piece Count**: How many pieces are developed vs my opponent?
- **Undeveloped Pieces**: Which pieces are still on starting squares?
- **Castle Status**:
  - Can I castle?
  - Should I castle kingside or queenside?
  - Has my opponent castled?
- **Center Control**: Do I have pawns controlling central squares?

## 3. Strategic Planning (Opening Focus)

- What's the first principles plan in this opening structure?
- Where do my pieces belong in this system?
- What's my next 2-3 move sequence to complete development?
- Should I fight for the center or accept a different structure?
- Which piece developments create the most threats?

## 4. Candidate Move Generation

Prioritize moves that:

- Develop a new piece toward the center
- Castle to safety
- Control central squares
- Create threats while developing
- Follow known opening theory (if applicable)
- Avoid moving already developed pieces without gaining tempo

## 5. Calculate & Verify

Pick a final move, out of the candidate moves.
Before making your move:

- Check 1-2 moves deep for tactics
- Will my opponent have annoying pins or attacks?
- Does this move allow quick development of remaining pieces?
- Am I falling into a known opening trap?
- Does this move fight for the initiative?

If the move doesn't pass these checks redo the checks with another candidate.
