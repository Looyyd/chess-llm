# Chess Move Selection Checklist - Middlegame

## 1. Safety & Tactics Check (Immediate Priorities)

- Is my king in check?
- Are any of my pieces hanging or attacked by lower-value pieces?
- Can I win material with a simple capture?
- Check for immediate tactical threats against me or that i can make
  - Forks
  - Pins
  - Skewers
  - Back rank mate threats
  - Discovered attacks

## 2. Positional Assessment

- **Pawn Structure**
  - Identify weak pawns (isolated, backward, doubled)
  - Locate passed pawns
  - Find potential pawn breaks
- **Piece Activity**
  - Which of my pieces are poorly placed?
  - Which enemy pieces are strong and need to be challenged?
  - Are there good outpost squares for my knights?
- **King Safety**
  - Compare both kings' safety
  - Look for potential attacking chances
- **Space & Control**
  - Who controls the center?
  - Are there key squares or files to fight for?

## 3. Strategic Planning

- What is my opponent's plan?
- What are the critical features of this position?
- What do I want to achieve in the next 3-5 moves?
- Which pieces need to be improved?
- What pawn breaks or exchanges would favor me?

## 4. Candidate Move Generation

Based on the above analysis, identify 3-4 candidate moves that:

- Address immediate threats (if any)
- Advance your strategic plan
- Improve your worst-placed piece
- Create threats or problems for your opponent
- Prepare favorable pawn breaks or exchanges

## 5. Calculate & Compare

For each candidate move:

- Calculate forcing variations 2-4 moves deep
- What is my opponent's best response?
- How does the resulting position compare to the current one?
- Does it create any weaknesses in my position?
- Does it achieve my strategic goals?

## 6. Final Verification

Pick a final move, out of the candidate moves.
Before making your move:

- Triple-check it doesn't hang anything
- Look one more time for opponent's tactical shots
- Are you satisfied this is the best move?
If not, redo the checks with another candidate.
